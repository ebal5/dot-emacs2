* Nth version of my Emacs settings

  Until now, I do not use Spacemacs.
  
  I think Vim's keybindings is very smart and fast for
  programming and any other works on Editor.
  
  But... I like Emacs as Envilonment. Many people think so,
  there is Spacemacs as I think.

* File lists...

  - Readme.org :: Document for this settings
  - init.el :: top loader of settings
  - elpa/ :: files installed from package.el
  - inits/ :: files wrote by me
